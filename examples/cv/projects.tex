\cvsubsection{Attitude Controller for Apollo 11 CSM}
\begin{cvparagraph}
Developed a quaternion geometric attidue controller for the Apollo 11 Command and Service module. Using feedback linearlization, found the commanded angles for the control moment gyros to drive the system to any desired attitude.
\end{cvparagraph}

\cvsubsection{Robotic Arm Inverted Pendulum}
\begin{cvparagraph}
Designed an operational space controller for inverted pendulum control on an arm of Rethink Robotics' Baxter unit. Implemented this controller in ROS and Gazebo using Rethink Robotics' Baxter SDK.
\end{cvparagraph}

\cvsubsection{Multiplicative Unscented Kalman Filter}
\begin{cvparagraph}
Developed an unscented kalman filter for fixed-wing attitude estimation. Implemented this estimator on a ROS simulation of a micro unmanned air vehicle with noisy accelerometers and gyros.
\end{cvparagraph}

\cvsubsection{Autopilot Implementation}
\begin{cvparagraph}
  Implemented the autopilot from \textit{Small Unmanned Aircraft: Theory and Practice} in C++ using the ROS framework. This includes an implementation of the controller, estimator, path planner and path manager.
\end{cvparagraph}

\cvsubsection{Deep Q Network}
\begin{cvparagraph}
  Replicated Google Deepmind's work on the Deep Q Network by training a reinforcement learning algorithm to play space invaders using only visual data.
\end{cvparagraph}

\cvsubsection{Heartbeat Segmentation \& Anomaly Detection}
\begin{cvparagraph}
  Segmented phonocardiograms and electrocardiograms into four states: S1, systole, S2 and Diastole. This was done using a hidden semi-markov model and the associated viterbi algorithm. Used these segmented heartbeats in anomaly detection using various classifiers: SVM, GDA, and MLP.
\end{cvparagraph}
